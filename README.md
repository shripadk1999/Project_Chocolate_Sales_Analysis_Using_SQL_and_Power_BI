# Project Chocolate Sales Analysis Using SQL and Power BI
Developed an insightful Chocolate Sales dashboard using Power BI to provide insights to the Sales Team.

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to comprehensively analyse the raw data and provide actionable insights through a dashboard for improving total sales of a chocolate shop.These  insights will prove helpful for the sales team for their further analysis.
Throughout this project, I've had the chance to:<br />
  * Dive deep into Chocolate Sales data to uncover valuable insights. <br />
  * Develop interactive dashboards to visualise key Sales Metrics.<br />
  * Provide data-driven recommendations for strategic decision-making.

## Steps Followed:
### 1. Data Gathering:
Importing raw data .csv file into Power BI & transform to Power Query editor for cleaning and data processing.
### 2. Data Cleaning:
* Cleaning is done by removing empty columns, removing duplicates, errors etc.<br />
* Replacing values in column with proper values and naming.<br />
* Detecting data type of every column, using the auto detect data type function in Power query editor and performing manual cross check.
### 3. Data Processing:
* In the Power Query editor, a new table called "Measure Table" was created  by using the DAX expression.Further new measures were created under this table such as Change in sales, Season Sales, Total Quantity Sold and Total Sales<br />
 * In DAX Query view, new Table called as “Calendar dimension” is added along with various new columns like Month, Month Number, Quarter, Year etc for time Intelligence Functions
### 4. Data Modelling:
 In Model View,One to Many relationships were established between dimension tables and fact tables. For this Star Schema is used.
### 5. Data Analysis:
* Analysis involves the creation of a range of visual representations, including bar charts, key performance indicators (KPIs), table charts, pie charts, and other relevant visualisations.<br />
* These tools are utilised to gain insights and present data in a comprehensive and easily understandable manner.

## Key Questions of The Dashboard:
* What are the Total Sales?<br />
* What are the Total Quantity Sold?<br />
* What is the Top Brand and Top City by Sales?<br />
* What is the gender wise distribution of Total Purchase amount ?<br />
* What is the Sales as per Chocolate type, Brand and Age Segment ?<br />
* What is the Daily, Monthly and Quarterly Sales Trend?<br />
* Graphical representation of sales by Cocoa Origin and City.<br />
## Learned About:
* Calculated Fields<br />
* Donut chart and Pie Chart<br />
* Bar Chart and Cluster chart 📊<br />
* KPI(Key Performance Indicators) and Slicer.<br />
* Filters: Used to filter data according to different City and Brands.<br />

## Key Insights Summary:
Dashboards provides real-time sales insights on: - <br />

* Chocolate Type (potential opportunity for increase in sales by 5% for Dark Chocolate), <br />
* Gender (identified a 7% sales increase for Male vis-a-vis Female) <br />
* Cost Segments (identified maximum share is of premium brands -38%).<br />
Observed Insights: <br />
* Quarterly: ~200% sales surge during festive season), <br />
* Monthly: (4x sales surge during Nov-Dec),<br />
* Daily: (~40% sales dip on Saturday as compared to Friday).<br />
Data-Driven Redistribution: Leveraged Continent-wise and City-wise analysis have potential to achieve a 10% improvement in chocolate redistribution efficiency.<br />
